# Programming Puzzles

I have been thinking about doing something like this for a while now, and after talking about it on Friday with Connor and Andrew, we have decided to give it a go!

The idea is that someone will provide a few problems/puzzles for everyone to solve over the following x days (once everyone who wants to give it a go has tried, we can then refresh the problem set).
The problems will be roughly ordered by difficulty, and you can do as many as you want (or none if you aren’t interested).

The problems that I set will most likely be from the Kattis problem archive - this is the main backend for the International Collegiate Programming Contest (ICPC), regional/world finals, and is by far the most popular platform for university computer science courses.

Difficulty ratings on Kattis range from 1 - 10, with 1 being easy, 1.5 - 2.5 being medium difficulty, and 2.5 - 4 being roughly equivalent to something like a leetcode hard problem, but they are much more varied and have some really interesting topics/concepts. Problems rated 4+ are the type of problem that you would typically only find in a regional contest or world finals, and can therefore be a really good learning experience.
I will start with a mix of easier problems, and we can then adjust either way depending on how everyone gets on. I will provide an editorial for all of the problems that I set (once I have done them), outlining the approach that I followed to solve it. You can then follow along and learn to solve harder problems over time.

We should probably limit the number of platforms that we use, to make things easier, but I’m open to using any platform as long as it’s free. You can sign up to Kattis easily and for free.
Language choice:

I would highly recommend using c++, as you may find that harder problems hit the time limit in interpreted languages like python, even if the actual solution is correct. This is also a really good way to gain experience with c++, if you want to, as you won’t be doing manual memory management and c++ has a fantastic standard template library. c++ syntax will also be more familiar than python if you are coming from php/js, as they all use c-style syntax. My editorial code will be in c++.
